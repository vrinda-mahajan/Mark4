        <p>In this blog i am going to explain an immensely used application of Blockchain Technology that is in cryptocurrency,
            and in order to understand cryptocurrency we will look at the current money system.
        </p>

        <h2>Fiat Money</h2>
        <p>
            The present money system is based on the concept of 'Fiat Money'.
            Fiat Money is the currency or the money issued by the government of a country . It gives central banks greater control over the
            economy because they can control how much money can be printed and in almost all the countries the concept of Fiat Money is used in the present times.​
             <br>The US Dollar ,the Indian Rupee are the example of fiat currencies.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Issues with current money System
        </h2>
        <p>There are two major problems with the present money system.
            <ul>
                <li>Control of government over the value of fiat money</li>
                <li>Unlimited money can be printed by the government​ because
                     there is a rule in economics that the more the money gets printed more is the inflation.</li>
            </ul>
            The first problem that is the control of government over the value of this Fiat money can be resolved by transacting in
            digital money through the UPI interfaces like Google pay, Phone pay etc. as we saw demonetisation has led to the
            rapid adoption of e-wallets<br> but the second problem the unlimited money printed by the government cannot be resolved by
            these UPI interfaces, as we saw in the recent past years the failure of centralised authorities like Yes Bank, Lakshmi Vilas
            bank and many others results in inflation in the economy of a country to overcome these problems the concept of
            cryptocurrency was introduced.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
        <p>Cryptocurrency is also a form of digital money but it is regulated by a decentralized system rather than a centralized authority.
        Blockchain is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrency which makes it secure. ​
        There are many cryptocurrencies in the market such as Ethereum , Litecoin , Ripple etc. but Bitcoin is the supreme.<br>
        <img class="crypto" src="images/cryptocurrencies.jpg">
        When a transaction is made through cryptocurrencies instead of storing its ledger or record in a centralized banking
        system it is shared among millions of systems across the world and once the information is shared it cannot be changed
        which adds to​ data security, data transparency​ etc.<br><br>
    ​ 
        This gives the person​<br>
    ​   1. the control over its own money by eliminating the middle man and ​<br>
    ​   2. the wrong decision of any government or any centralized authority will not affect his/her money.​
