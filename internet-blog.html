        <p>
            Internet is a thing which we use every single day and we completely take it for granted.
            It is really important that we understand how the internet actually works as it is a fundamental to understand web development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Internet simply is a long piece of wire that connects different computers with each other to communicate and to share
            data through this giant wire.Some of these computers on internet have a special job they have to be online 24/7 to serve you data and files that you
            are requesting when you try to access websites.They are known as web server and the computer that are requesting are known as client. 
            <h2>Some Terminologies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b> Service Provider</b>-a company that provides subscribers with access to the internet.
                </li>
                <li><b>Domain Name System(DNS)server</b>-The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet.DNS is
                    responsible for finding the correct IP address for the sites. Browsers then use those addresses to communicate
                    with origin servers to access website information.</li>
            </ul><br>
            You can imagine web server as a giant library that
            is open 24/7 and you can access different website, data and other resources at any hour of day but practically it is pretty
            difficult to access data from such a giant library.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Internet solves this problem. When you access a website for example www.google.com on your computer what happens behind
            the scene is that your browser will send a message to the internet service provider and they pass on the message to the
            DNS server which return the exact IP address of the website which you are looking for, back to your web browser. Every
            single computer that is connected to the internet has its own unique IP address which acts more like a postal address for
            your computer.
        </p>
        <p>After receiving the IP address now your web browser again will send the request directly to the server located at that
        address via Internet Service Provider. The server sends all those files back to the web browser through the internet
        and we are able to see the website on our computer. All of this happens just in a matter of milliseconds.
